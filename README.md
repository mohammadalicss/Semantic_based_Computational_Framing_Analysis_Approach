# Semantic-based Unsupervised Framing Analysis (SUFA)
This repository provides the implementation of Semantic-based Unsupervised Framing Analysis (SUFA), a novel computational method for analyzing entity-centric emphasis frames in news reports. SUFA combines semantic relations and dependency parsing to offer a mixed-method approach for framing analysis.

## Key Features
+ Novel Approach: SUFA goes beyond the existing computational framing analysis approaches' bag-of-word approach and applied semantic relations-based approaches. To develop this novel appraoch, the project integrates qualitative and computational methods for framing analysis. Though the SUFA is an unsupervised approach, it allows qualitative input while further investigating into a data.
+ Gun violence: Demonstrated using a dataset on gun violence.
+ Versatility: Applicable in both social and computational sciences.

## Contents
This repository includes Python script implementing SUFA using semantic relations and dependency parsing algorithms. The project's script in this repository is until the initial version of the methodological innovation. 

### Update:
Currently, we are further working on advancing the SUFA approach with automating the clustering process of framing devices into the broader frames centering an individual entity. This repo script will be updated as the ongoing project advancing the SUFA is finished.

# Applications
SUFA can be used for framing analysis in various domains, including:
+ Journalism 
+ Public Relations
+ News media studies
+ Political communication
+ Public opinion research
